# PharmacyDatabase
From the case study of a pharmacy provided to me I was required to complete the following:

- Build the appropriate SQL to create the tables.
* You can use Erwin to generate the SQL however you need to make sure you rename all constraints.
- Build the appropriate SQL to populate the tables with data.
- Build the appropriate SQL to retrieve data according to requirements given.
- Build the appropriate SQL to alter the data structures according to requirements given.
- Appropriately comment your SQL.
